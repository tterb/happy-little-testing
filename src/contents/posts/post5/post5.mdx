Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in [here](#).  

Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll have a super time. This is a fantastic little painting.  

Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.
