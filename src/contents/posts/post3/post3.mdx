These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. In your world you have total and absolute power. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. You can do anything your heart can imagine. You need to have a very firm paint to do this.  

[Imagination is the key to painting](#). This is the fun part This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy.  
Even the worst thing we can do here is good. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Let your heart be your guide. Poor old tree.
