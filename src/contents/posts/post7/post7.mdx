Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? This is truly an almighty mountain. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.  

Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.  

Don't fight it, use what happens. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path.
