I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall.  

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Let all these things just sort of happen. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. <AwesomeLink>Let the paint work</AwesomeLink>.  

Trees grow however makes them happy. Here we're limited by the time we have. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and <AwesomeLink>stuff</AwesomeLink>.
