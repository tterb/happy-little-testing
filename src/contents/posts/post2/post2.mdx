So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Everybody needs a friend. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Let's do it again then, what the heck. Use what you see, don't plan it.  

We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. This is your world. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. And maybe, maybe, maybe... [Let your imagination be your guide](#).  

All those little son of a guns. Use your imagination, let it go. That's crazy. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch.
