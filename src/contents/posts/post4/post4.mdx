You can create anything that makes you happy. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. In this world, everything can be happy. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun.  

Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do.  

Work that paint. Happy painting, God bless. A little happy sunlight shining through there. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.
