A big strong tree needs big strong roots. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. We'll paint one happy little tree right here. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. If you hypnotize it, it will go away.  

I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Learn when to stop. We don't have anything but happy trees here.  

Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Let your heart be your guide. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Zip. That easy. You need the dark in order to show the light.
