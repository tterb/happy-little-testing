We might as well make some [Almighty mountains](#) today as well, what the heck. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Here's another little happy bush We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Have fun with it.  

The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Every time you practice, you learn more. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.  

Let that brush dance around there and play. Work that paint. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. Little short strokes.
